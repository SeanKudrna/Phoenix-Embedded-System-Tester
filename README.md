# Phoenix-Embedded-System-Tester
This project consists of a series of GUIs that allow interaction with BK
Precision products such as the 2831E DMM, 9201 power supply, 9205 power supply,
as well as a dac, and a series of relays. 

The purpose of these GUI's is to allow easy automated testing of each piece
of the equipment.
